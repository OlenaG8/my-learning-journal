    <h5>How I stay commited to learning</h5>
    <p>My current team leader once said that I come across as someone who is always eager to learn and explore new things.
    I believe these words describe my personality the most accurately.
    <br><br>
    Since I was a kid, I've always been into a bunch of stuff - drawing, sewing, crocheting, even messing around with clay. 
    As I got older, I got into physics, math, 3D design, and all sorts of other things. 
    I had several approaches to programming at different ages, but I never took it seriously because I was influenced by many stereotypes.
    <br><br>
    To wrap up, I've never felt the need for external motivation to learn because it's simply a part of who I am.
    </p>
    <h5>How I got into programming</h5>
    <p>Two years ago, I transitioned into a full-time role at an excellent company with a supportive team and a positive work culture. 
    However, outside of work hours, I found myself bored and struggling to find meaningful ways to invest my time into.
    <br><br>
    Afterwards, through a curious twist of fate, I crossed paths with someone at a coffee shop. 
    This individual shared their journey as a website architect, highlighting how despite lacking formal education, they were recognized as an expert and regularly invited to speak at seminars worldwide.
    <br><br>
    Their story inspired me, so I felt the need to give it a shot myself.
